How to Fetch Data (The "Hybrid" Way)

In Next.js, you often want to prefetch data on the server (for SEO and speed) and then hydrate it on the client (so React Query takes over for updates).

prefetch = phele se he data/resourse ko load kar lena , taak baad me wait na karna pade.

Real-life analogy

Socho aap restaurant me ho:

-> Aapne menu dekha

-> Waiter samajh gaya ki aap pizza order karoge

-> Wo kitchen ko pehle hi bol deta hai

-> Jab aap order dete ho → pizza jaldi aa jata hai

Ye hi prefetching hai.

hydrate / hydartion = hydration is the process where javascript attaches intractivity to HTML that was alread rendered on the server.

in short :  server se aaya hua static HTML -> javascript ke through interactive UI ban jata hai
